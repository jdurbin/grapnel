// This is file specifying a range of bulk classifier experiments to perform. 
// There are two main sections, expand, and parameters.  Things in the expand
// section will be interpreted according to two expansion rules: 
// 
// * Braces {} will be expanded with {start,end,step} values. 
// * $keyword will be expanded with previously defined keyword expansions. 
// 
// Expansions can be nested to obtain a very compact description of a multi-dimensional
// experiment. 
// 
// The parameters section of the configuration file will serve mostly the role
// of defining global parameters, not unlike traditional java parameters files. 
// Groovy syntax is interpreted throughout both sections, providing additional ways 
// to specify complex parameters.  
//
// An advantage to including the parameters and the expandable experiment strings in 
// same config file is that a single file more completely documents the experiment 
// performed.   Add a verison or something that gets printed with the output and 
// you can easily link any output you find to the file that created it. 
//  

expand{
    // Arbitrary parameter names are allowed here (i.e. things you make up). Subsequent usage 
    // of $kernel, or $eval, or whatever, will expand to all of these strings.  Within each of 
    // these strings, range specs {start,end,step} will expand these strings.  So, below, 
    // the first line will expand to twelve different kernel specs.  So if a classifier
    // includes $kernel, it will get expanded into twelve different classifier lines each 
    // with one of the twelve kernels.
